            <p class="section_tag ">Scenario of Indian Education System</p>
            <p class="section_subtag small_text">In the 2011 Census, about 73% of the population was literate, with 81%
                for males and 65% for females. National Statistical Commission surveyed literacy to be 77.7% in 2017â€“18,
                84.7% for male and 70.3% for female.This compares to 1981 when the respective rates were 41%, 53% and
                29%. <br> In 1951 the rates were 18%, 27% and 9%. India's improved education system is often cited as one of
                the main contributors to its economic development. Much of the progress, especially in higher education
                and scientific research, has been credited to various public institutions. While enrolment in higher
                education has increased steadily over the past decade, reaching a Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) of 26.3%
                in 2019, there still remains a significant distance to catch up with tertiary education enrolment levels
                of developed nations, a challenge that will be necessary to overcome in order to continue to reap a
                demographic dividend from India's comparatively young population</p>

            <p class="section_tag ">New Education Policy</p>
            <p class="section_subtag small_text">Education policy is prepared by the Central Government and State Governments at national and state levels respectively. The National Policy on Education (NPE), 1986, has provided for environment awareness, science and technology education, and introduction of traditional elements such as Yoga into the Indian secondary school system. <br> A significant feature of India's secondary school system is the emphasis on inclusion of the disadvantaged sections of the society.[citation needed] Professionals from established institutes are often called to support in vocational training. Another feature of India's secondary school system is its emphasis on profession based vocational training to help students attain skills for finding a vocation of his/her choosing. <br> A significant new feature has been the extension of SSA to secondary education in the form of the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan. <br> Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) which is the most recent initiative of Government of India to achieve the goal of universalisation of secondary education (USE). It is aimed at expanding and improving the standards of secondary education up to class X.</p>
